New Clan App based on the FAF API

This App is based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and is a [Single Page Application (SPA)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Single-page_application). For faster development and to keep the design and usage similar the old app some bootstrap components are used. 

The Endpoint of this app is the [FAF-API](https://github.com/FAForever/api). From my view the current python implementation is not stable and hard to extend, so I used the Java Implementation from downlord: https://github.com/micheljung/faf-java-api/tree/feature/clan
