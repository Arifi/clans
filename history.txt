- I have some more free time again! yay!
- going to restart work
- hard thinking about how to refactor the messaging system to get around the user->user design, and allow indirection (i.e. a virtual recipient such as "current clan leader for clan XYZ"). notes appended at end of this doco.

2013-8-8
- I now have some idea how to design the message system
- do some implementation: 
  - new DB tables schema, 
  - new classes for recipients (mapping virtual recievers -> real players)
  - modify the "join clan" action page to use the new classes

2013-8-12
- time to get grown-up and start using a DCVS, i'll go with bitbucket/mercurial just like uncle Zepilot.
- new bitbucket account is *hartbren*, repo is "faf_clans_webapp"
- write a readme.txt
- inital import, scary!






~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notes and musings below here 


===============================
Message indirection thoughts:
===============================
* Need to be able to :
- send message to specific player

- send message to current clan leader of clan XYZ
  -> active messages available even if leader changes
  
- send message to all current clan members of clan XYZ
  -> players who join clan after message sent do not get message
  -> players who leave clan after message sent no longer have message in inbox


* Need functions which will:

- get all (active) messages for player
  -> not in a clan                    
    recipient id -> player id 

select message.*, seen JOIN playerSeenMessages on messageid = seen_message=id and playerid = playerid
join recipients on message.recipientid = recipient.recipientID and recipient.type = PLAYER and recipient.entity_id = playerid
where message.status = active

  -> in a clan
      recipient ids are player id  AND clan id

select message.*, seen 
JOIN playerSeenMessages on message.messageid = playerSeenMessages.messageid and playerSeenMessages.playerid = playerid
join recipients 
  on 
    message.recipientid = recipient.recipientID 
    and (
      ( recipient.type = PLAYER and recipient.entity_id = playerid ) 
      OR 
      ( recipient.type = CLAN_ALL and recipient.entity_id = clanid ) 
    )
where message.status = active
    
  -> in a clan and leader of clan
      recipient ids are player id  AND clan id and clan leader id
  
select message.*, seen 
JOIN playerSeenMessages on message.messageid = playerSeenMessages.messageid and playerSeenMessages.playerid = playerid
join recipients 
  on 
    message.recipientid = recipient.recipientID 
    and (
      ( recipient.type = PLAYER and recipient.entity_id = playerid ) 
      OR 
      ( recipient.type = CLAN_ALL and recipient.entity_id = clanid )
      OR 
      ( recipient.type = CLAN_LEADER and recipient.entity_id = clanid ) 
    )
where message.status = active


* Message types

- petition to join        : player -> clan leader
- invite to join          : clan leader -> player
- message to clan members : clan member -> clan members except self

The following Actions result in change to messages:

- refuse petition         : update petiton message with response
- refuse invite           : update invite message with response
- clan leader change      : new clan leader will see active messages automatically 
- clan member join        : no change
- clan member leaves      : close active messages from clan


* Need some

--get messageids which are for clan recipients
update playerSeenMessages set status=HIDE where messageid in (
select messageid from messages join recipient on message.recipientID = recipient.receipientID and reciepientID.type = CLAN_ALL and enetityID = clanID)

select message.messageID from messages
where not exists (select * from playerSeenMessages where playerid = X and messages.messageid = playerSeenMessages.messageID) and
